# EVM-to-EVM cross-chain bridge is the most requested tool. 
We've got 10+ requests where clients can pay 1000-5000$ for such a solution. We planned to release this tool in 2-3 months and ask our community to crowdfund this development. You can buy 1 license NFT for 1000 USDC. 

# 1 license = 1000 USDC. For this price you will get:

- 1 license allow you to deploy and manage "anyswap.exchange clone" on 1 domain
- 1 license guarantees 1 year of support and updates (then you need to buy another one)

A: "Reuse the code" is not easy, for example, this step-by-step guide on how to deploy uniswap v2 https://onout.org/uniswapFork/ dex. To create this guide we perform massive research of their contracts and codebase, then we release the admin tool which does all these steps "in one click". Such R&D takes 2 months minimum.
